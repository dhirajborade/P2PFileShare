{"name":"p2pfileshare","tagline":"A Distributed Peer-to-Peer File-Sharing System","body":"# Distributed Peer-to-Peer System\r\n\r\n**A peer-to-peer (P2P) system, for the purpose of the project, consists of a set of autonomous computers**\r\n**that act as a distributed repository of files, and allow participating computers to search for and download**\r\n**files from each other.**\r\n\r\nThe model to consider is the following:\r\n\r\n1. Each computer, Ci, maintains a file, Fi that contains a list of files (and associated keywords) that are\r\nbeing made visible to the outside world. Only the files in Fi can be downloaded from Ci by other computers.\r\n\r\n2. When a computer, Ci, wishes to join the P2P system it is assumed that it knows of at least one other\r\ncomputer, Cj , that is already part of the P2P system. If Ci is the node that initiates the P2P system then Ci knows that, too.\r\n\r\n3. In order to join the P2P system, computer Ci sends a join request to Cj . Both Ci and Cj add each other to their list of neighbors and establish a TCP connection between themselves.\r\n\r\n## File Sharing Procedure\r\n\r\n### Simple search approach:\r\n\r\nSimple Search Approach: If computer Ck is looking for a file, it can issue the search request using either\r\na file name or a keyword, and a hop-count which is initially set to 1.\r\n\r\n1. The search request is flooded into the overlay network (along the links represented by the list of\r\nneighbors) to other computers that are no more than hop-count away from the computer issuing the\r\nsearch request. Having initiated the search request, Ck starts a timer which is set to expire after\r\nthop count seconds.\r\n2. You must ensure that a computer forwards a search request issued by another computer at most once,\r\ni.e., your implementation should be able to detect duplicate requests.\r\n3. Let there be a computer Cx that has a file, listed in the corresponding Fx, whose name matches the\r\nspecified file name, or whose keyword matches the specified keyword. Then, Cx sends a response to\r\nthe neighbor from which it received the first copy of the search request. The response contains Cx,\r\nand the keyword and file name of the matched entry.\r\nIf a computer that initiated the search request (Ck) receives a reply, it consumes the reply.\r\n5. When a computer that did not initiate the search request (Cl) receives a reply, it forwards the reply\r\nto the neighbor from which it received the first copy of the corresponding search request.\r\n6. As part of consuming a reply, the search initiator, Ck, collects all the replies received until the expiry of\r\nthe timer, and then displays them as a list of tuples of the form (kwd, file name, comp name). Replies\r\nreceived after the expiry of the timer are ignored.\r\n7. The user, on Ck, that made the request can specify which response tuple he/she is interested in.\r\n8. If the selected tuple corresponds to a file located at computer Cm then Ck establishes a TCP session\r\nwith Cm and copies the file from Cm to its own directory, and updates Fk accordingly. Once the file\r\nhas been copied from Cm, the TCP session established with Cm for the purpose of obtaining the file\r\nis terminated.\r\n9. If the search terminated without success (no reply received before the timer expired), then Cm should\r\ndouble the hop-count and re-initiate the process. This should be repeated until there is success, or the\r\nhop-count exceeds sixteen (whichever happens earlier). Note that the timer value is a monotonically\r\nincreasing function of hop-count.\r\n\r\n## Termination\r\n\r\nHaving grown to fifteen nodes, you should initiate departure of nodes, one at a time. If a departing\r\nnode has only one neighbor then all that node has to do before departing is to terminate its TCP\r\nsession with its neighbor and all ongoing TCP file transfer sessions. If a departing node has two or\r\nmore neighbors then before departing it should arbitrarily select one of its neighbors, n1, and make\r\nit a neighbor of all other neighbors (provided the two nodes are not already neighbors of each other).\r\nThen, it should terminate its TCP sessions with all its neighbors as well the ongoing TCP file transfer\r\nsessions.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
